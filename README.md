# Pool

Tools and issue tracker for user requests to the HPC pool directories.

## Tools:
* Sync tool to ensure you can easily pull from DRKZ Levante considered to be the "Truth"
* Recheck links if something has a different relative path on Levante vs. e.g. Ollie

## Issue Tracker
* Users should be able to request pool changes here instead of via the helpdesk.
